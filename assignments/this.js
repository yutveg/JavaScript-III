/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Binding is the default pointer returned for 'this' when it is called in a non-strict global scope
* 2. Implicit binding is the process where this points to the object it is connected to by a "." on its right
* 3. New binding is when this points to the new object being created by a constructor
* 4. Explicit binding is when this points at an object attached to the "call/apply" methods
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
